# BFS-and-DFS-algorithms
Implementation of BFS and DFS algorithms

BFS and DFS are two primary algorithms used to visit individual nodes of graph and they have significant importance in many real world applications. 
In the files bfs.c and dfs.c I will be implementing BFS and DFS respectively using adjacency list. When these programs are executed, adjacency list of graphs will get printed and then user can enter source vertex from which traversing will begin. 
Four parameters are displayed on screen for the output: vertex (indicating which vertex is being traversed), parent vertex (which vertex was traversed prior to visiting the current one) and color ('g' indicates that the vertex has been traversed while 'w' indicates it remains to be visited).
The color parameter will help ensure that all vertices have been visited during implementation of algorithm. 

The code can be executed by simply giving the following command: gcc <name of file>.
